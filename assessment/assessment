# Course Assessment QAP 2 – Java
**Noah Whiffen – SD12**  
**February 10th, 2025**

1. The Line class only took me between an hour or two, as I already had the MyPoint class from a previous project. The rectangle took me 4 or 5 hours, spread out over an entire day, and then some minor bug fixes the following day that took about 20 minutes. The credit card and all aggregated classes took me about the 5 or 6 hours spread out over a day.

2. I used Youtube to touch up on my geometry for the rectangle class, (I’m one of those crazy people that enjoys math lol). AI for bug fixing and to discuss syntax, (all code is my own aside from parts with comments stating otherwise), as well as various random sites from Google.

3. I asked my group mates (Noah L and Jonathan for help).

4. I did not ask any instructors for help.

5. MyLine I would rate 5 out of 5. Rectangle a 4 (beyond the geometry hiccup it was straightforward.) The credit card I would rate a 3, that one was more difficult. I am confident that I could solve similar problems in the future, and I had a lot of fun with these!
