**How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each** 
**individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)**

1. The Line class only took me between an hour or two, as I already had the MyPoint class from a previous project. 
The rectangle took me 4 or 5 hours, spread out over an entire day, and then some minor bug fixes the following day that took about 20 minutes. 
The credit card and all aggregated classes took me about the 5 or 6 hours spread out over a day.

**What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)**

2. I used Youtube to touch up on my geometry for the rectangle class, (I’m one of those crazy people that enjoys math lol). 
AI for bug fixing and to discuss syntax, (all code is my own aside from parts with comments stating otherwise), as well as various random sites from Google.

**Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)**

3. I asked my group mates (Noah L and Jonathan for help).

**Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?**

4. I did not ask any instructors for help.

**Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a** 
**similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that you’ve completed this one.**

5. MyLine I would rate 5 out of 5. Rectangle a 4 (beyond the geometry hiccup it was straightforward.) The credit card I would rate a 3, 
that one was more difficult. I am confident that I could solve similar problems in the future, and I had a lot of fun with these!
